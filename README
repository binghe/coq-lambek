Name : Lambek-Calculus
Title: A Coq toolkit for Lambek Calculus
Authors: Houda ANOUN & Pierre CASTERAN
Institution: LaBRI , Bordeaux 
Date : March - July 2003
===========================================

Description: 
------------

This library contains some definitions concerning Lambek calculus ...
Three formalisations of this calculus are proposed, and also some certified
 functions which translate derivations from one formalism to another...
Several derived properties are proved and also some meta-theorems...
Users can define their own lexicons and use the defined tactics to prove the
derivation of sentences in a particular system (L, NL, LP, NLP ...)

Keywords: Computational linguistic, categorial grammar, Lambek Calculus...
--------


Interested users can find more details about this library in the INRIA research report 
titled 'Logical Toolkit for Lambek Calculus'
